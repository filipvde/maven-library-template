# How It Works
# 1) It listens for pull requests that are closed on develop.
# 2) If the PR was merged (not just closed), the workflow runs.
# 3) It creates a new PR from develop to master using the peter-evans/create-pull-request action.

# Requirements
# => Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has permissions to create PRs (default permissions are usually sufficient).
# => You can customize the PR title, body, and labels as needed.

# Steps the workflow performs:
# 1) Triggers on a pull request merge to the develop branch.
# 2) Checks if the PR was merged successfully.
# 3) Creates a pull request from develop to master.

# IMPORTANT ACTION:
# For this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests. 
# This setting can be found in a repository's settings under 
# REPO SETTINGS > Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
# => click on "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
